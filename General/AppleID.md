The **email address domain** for an **Apple account (Apple ID)** depends on what email you used when you created it.

Here are the common cases:

1. **If you created your Apple ID with an Apple email**, the domain will be one of the following:

   * `@icloud.com`
   * `@me.com` (older accounts)
   * `@mac.com` (very old accounts from the early Mac.com service)

2. **If you used a non-Apple email** (like Gmail or Outlook), then your Apple ID domain is whatever email provider you used, such as:

   * `@gmail.com`
   * `@outlook.com`
   * `@yahoo.com`
   * etc.

So, for example:

* An Apple-hosted Apple ID might look like: `example@icloud.com`
* A third-party Apple ID might look like: `example@gmail.com`
