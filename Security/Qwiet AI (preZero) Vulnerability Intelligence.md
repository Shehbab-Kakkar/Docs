# 🛡️ Qwiet AI (preZero) Vulnerability Intelligence: Where Does It Get CVEs?

This document explains **where Qwiet AI (formerly ShiftLeft)** gathers its vulnerability intelligence for AppSec scanning, especially for CVE detection, Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and automated remediation.

## ✅ What is Qwiet AI?

Qwiet AI is an AI-powered code security platform that unifies SAST, SCA, secrets scanning, container analysis, and SBOM—all in one tool. It analyzes custom code and open-source dependencies, reporting vulnerabilities and providing AI-generated fixes.

## 📚 Where Does Qwiet AI Get Vulnerability Data?

Qwiet AI uses a **hybrid approach**: it aggregates, correlates, and enriches vulnerability data from multiple centralized databases and its own proprietary feed.

### 1. **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**
- The primary, global CVE registry maintained by NIST.
- Provides CVE IDs, CVSS scores, affected versions, descriptions, and CWE mappings.
- Qwiet regularly syncs with the NVD feed for baseline vulnerability data.

### 2. **GitHub Security Advisories**
- Public, curated database maintained by GitHub for ecosystem vulnerabilities (npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.).
- Includes early disclosures and community patches, sometimes faster than NVD.

### 3. **OSS Index (by Sonatype)**
- Commercial, curated open-source vulnerability database.
- Offers aggressive updates, transitive dependency insights, and ecosystem-specific issues.

### 4. **Language/Ecosystem-Specific Advisory Feeds**
| Ecosystem       | Advisory Source              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| npm/JavaScript  | npm Advisories, Snyk        |
| Python/PyPI     | PyUp, PyPI advisories       |
| Java/Maven      | Sonatype, Maven Central     |
| RubyGems        | RubySec                     |
| Go modules      | Go vuln DB                  |
| Rust/Cargo      | RustSec                     |

- Qwiet pulls from these for faster and more granular coverage.

### 5. **Qwiet’s Proprietary Curated Database**
- Qwiet aggregates, de-duplicates, and enriches all the above sources.
- Adds:
    - Reachability analysis (is the CVE exploitable in your app?)
    - AI-based exploitability scoring
    - Remediation recommendations (AI AutoFix)
    - Early disclosures, zero-days, and customer feedback

## 🔄 How Does Qwiet Use This Data?

1. **Dependency Analysis**
    - Parses manifest files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`)
    - Resolves transitive dependencies

2. **CVE Matching**
    - Compares dependency versions against all known vulnerabilities from NVD, GitHub, OSS Index, language-specific DBs, and Qwiet’s internal DB

3. **Exploitability Assessment**
    - Uses Code Property Graph (CPG) to check if the vulnerable code is imported, reachable, or actually exploitable in your app

4. **Reporting & AutoFix**
    - Outputs CVE ID, severity, affected/fixed versions, and remediation steps
    - AI AutoFix suggests and can apply fixes (e.g., upgrades, code changes)

---

## 🧠 Why Not Just NVD?

- **Speed:** Some advisories are available in GitHub or OSS Index before they make it to NVD.
- **Depth:** Ecosystem-specific DBs often have more detail or context.
- **Accuracy:** Qwiet’s internal DB reduces false positives by considering exploitability and real usage in your code.

## 🔧 Example: Scan Output

```json
{
  "cve": "CVE-2024-12345",
  "package": "requests",
  "affected_version": "<2.28.0",
  "fixed_version": "2.28.1",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "exploitability": "YES",
  "recommendation": "Upgrade requests to >=2.28.1",
  "autofix": {
    "status": "ready",
    "change": "Update requirements.txt line 5 to requests==2.28.1"
  }
}
```

| Source                | Type              | Used For                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| NVD                   | Global CVE Feed   | Baseline vulnerability intelligence      |
| GitHub Advisories     | Ecosystem CVEs    | Faster updates, community fixes          |
| OSS Index             | Curated CVEs      | Transitive/package-level insights        |
| Language-specific DBs | Advisory feeds    | Extra coverage for npm, PyPI, Maven, etc.|
| Qwiet proprietary DB  | Aggregated/enriched| Exploitability, AutoFix, prioritization  |

## 🏁 Key Takeaways

- Qwiet AI does **not** rely on a single database, but aggregates and augments from the world’s leading vulnerability feeds.
- All findings are enriched with context (reachability, severity, fix recommendations) and can be auto-remediated using Qwiet’s AI.
- This ensures **faster, more accurate, and actionable** vulnerability detection than using NVD or a single source alone.
