AWS has 200+ services, but you can get 90% of real work done by mastering these 10. Learn these first and get productive fast:
• S3 – object storage
• DynamoDB – fast, scalable NoSQL
• Lambda – serverless compute
• Cognito – auth & user management
• API Gateway – manage HTTP/WebSocket APIs
• EventBridge – route domain events
• SQS – queue work for async processing
• SNS – push notifications & fan-out
• IAM – identities, roles, permissions
• CloudFormation – infrastructure as code (feel free to substitute this with CDK, Pulumi, SST, Serverless Framework, Terraform, etc.)

With just these 10 services, you can build:

• REST APIs: API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB, secured by Cognito (JWT authorizer).
• Event-driven architectures: Producers publish events to EventBridge; Lambda consumers process them. Add SQS queues to buffer spikes & capture failed messages. Optionally add SNS to fan-out to other services or email.
• File upload & processing: Use presigned S3 URLs to securely upload files to S3. Then use S3 notifications to process uploads with Lambda.
• Background/Cron jobs: Use EventBridge Scheduler to run nightly reports, cleanup jobs, etc. with Lambda.
• Real-time notifications (WebSockets): API Gateway WebSocket API + Lambda + DynamoDB (to store connections).
• Auth & user flows: Use Cognito Hosted UI to manage user flows and use Cognito User Pools & API Gateway to protect your API.
• Multi-tenant SaaS: Use Cognito groups to model multi-tenancy.
• Webhook & fan-out: API Gateway receives webhook events → Lambda validates them → enqueue to SQS → downstream Lambdas update DynamoDB or fan-out via SNS.

These are just a few examples of what you can do!

If you feel overwhelmed as a beginner, focus on these and they can take you pretty far already.

ps. EC2, VPC, and ECS are intentionally missing. You don’t need them to be productive early on. Start with higher-level services that give you more leverage so you can do more with less.
