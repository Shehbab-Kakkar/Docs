## 1️⃣ First: Understand what “load” actually means

**Load average ≠ CPU usage**

Load average = number of processes that are:

* **Running on CPU**, or
* **Waiting for CPU**, or
* **Stuck in uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O wait)**

👉 High load can be caused by:

* CPU saturation
* Disk I/O bottlenecks
* Memory pressure / swapping
* Hung NFS / storage / network filesystem
* Too many runnable processes

---

## 2️⃣ Check load vs CPU cores (sanity check)

```bash
uptime
nproc
```

Example:

```
load average: 12.5, 11.8, 10.9
CPU cores: 4
```

🚨 Load **>> CPU cores** = real problem
✅ Load ≈ cores = system is busy but expected

---

## 3️⃣ Identify WHAT is contributing to the load

### 🔍 A. CPU bottleneck

```bash
top
```

Press:

* `1` → per-CPU view
* `P` → sort by CPU

Look for:

* `%us` high → user processes
* `%sy` high → kernel/syscalls
* `%wa` low → not I/O related

Also:

```bash
mpstat -P ALL 1 5
```

**Root causes:**

* Infinite loops
* Too many threads
* Bad application logic
* Crypto / compression overload

---

### 🔍 B. I/O wait (very common cause)

```bash
top
```

If `%wa` is high → disk or network storage problem.

Confirm with:

```bash
iostat -xz 1 5
```

Watch:

* `%util` near 100%
* `await` high (>20ms SSD, >50ms HDD)
* `svctm` vs `await` gap

Find offenders:

```bash
iotop -oPa
```

**Root causes:**

* Slow disks
* NFS latency
* Backup jobs
* Log flooding
* Database fsync storms

---

### 🔍 C. Memory pressure / swapping

```bash
free -h
vmstat 1 5
```

Red flags:

* Swap used heavily
* `si` / `so` non-zero
* Low `available` memory

Check who eats RAM:

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
```

**Root causes:**

* Memory leak
* JVM heap mis-sizing
* Too many services
* Kernel cache pressure

---

### 🔍 D. Too many runnable processes

```bash
vmstat 1 5
```

Check:

* `r` column (run queue)

  * If `r` > CPU cores → CPU contention

List process states:

```bash
ps -eo pid,stat,cmd | grep D
```

`D` state = uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O wait)

**Root causes:**

* Hung storage
* NFS freeze
* Blocked kernel calls

---

## 4️⃣ Drill into kernel & system health

### Check system pressure (RHEL 9 feature)

```bash
cat /proc/pressure/{cpu,memory,io}
```

This shows **how long the system was stalled** — extremely useful.

---

### Kernel logs

```bash
journalctl -k -p err
dmesg -T | tail -50
```

Look for:

* I/O errors
* Filesystem warnings
* OOM killer events
* NFS timeouts

---

## 5️⃣ Correlate with time (very important)

```bash
sar -q
sar -u
sar -d
sar -r
```

This answers:

* Did load spike suddenly?
* Is it recurring at specific times?
* Did disk or memory degrade first?

---

## 6️⃣ Common real-world root causes (from experience)

| Symptom                | Likely Root Cause   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| High load + low CPU    | Disk / NFS latency  |
| High load + swap       | Memory leak         |
| High load after reboot | Service misconfig   |
| Load spikes at night   | Backup / cron jobs  |
| Load stuck forever     | Hung filesystem     |
| High `%sy`             | Kernel bug / driver |

---

## 7️⃣ Root cause checklist (use this mentally)

Ask yourself:

* Did **CPU**, **disk**, or **memory** saturate first?
* Is load **runnable** or **blocked**?
* Is it **one process** or **many**?
* Did anything **change** (deploy, patch, config)?
